# Browser Storage

To reduce the load on the backend API and improve performance, PRUNplanner stores game data directly in your browser. This allows for faster access and a smoother user experience. The tool also automatically refreshes stored data after a set period to ensure it remains up to date.

## Storage Categories

- **Game Data**
  This includes mostly static information such as materials, buildings, recipes, planetary data, and exchange details. It is sourced from FIO or, in the case of exchange data, calculated by PRUNplanner. Exchange data is refreshed more frequently to ensure accurate profit and cost calculations.

- **Planning Data**
  This category contains your personal planning information, including your empires, plans, exchange preferences, and any shared plans.

- **FIO Data**
  This refers to your in-game personal data, such as storage and site information. To access this, you can link your Prosperous Universe account by providing your username and a FIO API key. PRUNplanner will periodically check for updates and automatically sync the latest data from the backend.

# Preferences

Preferences allow you to save frequently used settings and configurations, making your planning process more efficient and personalized.

For example:

- **Default Empire**
  Your preferred empire is automatically loaded when you access the empire view, saving you from having to select it manually each time.

- **Burn View Thresholds**
  If you're using PRUNplanner in combination with FIO to monitor your base inventories, you can set red and yellow thresholds for stock levels. These thresholds help you identify when to send resupply ships and are saved in your browser for convenience.

Tool-wide preferences can be managed directly from your profile or adjusted within the relevant views. Plan-specific settings can be modified within each linked plan.
